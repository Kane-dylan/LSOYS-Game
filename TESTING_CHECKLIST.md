# Bug Fixes and Feature Testing Checklist

## âœ… Fixed Bugs

### 1. Player Gravity/Jump Physics

- **Issue**: Player started floating above ground, gravity worked in wrong direction
- **Fix**: Updated coordinate system so player starts at `PLAYER.GROUND_Y` (64px from bottom) and falls down to ground level
- **Testing**: Player should start on ground and jump upward, then fall back down naturally

### 2. Duck-Type Obstacles Positioning

- **Issue**: Duck obstacles spawned at ground level, impossible to duck under
- **Fix**: Duck obstacles now spawn at `PLAYER.GROUND_Y + OBSTACLE.DUCK_Y_OFFSET` (30px above ground)
- **Testing**: Duck obstacles appear floating above ground, player can duck underneath them

### 3. Obstacle Spacing

- **Issue**: No minimum gap enforcement between obstacles
- **Fix**: Added `hasMinimumGap` check ensuring obstacles maintain minimum distance based on difficulty
- **Testing**: Obstacles should never spawn too close together, providing fair gameplay

## ðŸŽ® How to Test

1. **Start Game**: Press SPACE to begin
2. **Jump**: Use SPACE or UP arrow, verify player jumps and falls naturally to ground
3. **Duck**: Use DOWN arrow, verify player ducks and can go under red "DUCK" obstacles
4. **Flame Power**: Build up flame meter, use SHIFT to burn obstacles
5. **Obstacles**: Verify proper spacing between obstacles, both jump and duck types
6. **Game States**: Test pause (ESC), restart (R), help (H), leaderboard (L)
7. **Mobile**: Test touch controls on mobile device
8. **Audio**: Toggle sound with M key
